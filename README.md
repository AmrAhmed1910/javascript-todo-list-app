# JavaScript ToDo List Application

## Description
This project is a simple ToDo List application built using vanilla JavaScript, styled with consistent colors and layouts inspired by a previous HTML and CSS project. The application allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as finished, automatically moving tasks between the "ToDo" and "Finished" sections.

## Features
- **Add Task:** Create new tasks, which are added to the "ToDo" section.
- **Edit Task:** Modify existing tasks directly within the list.
- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks from either the "ToDo" or "Finished" section.
- **Mark as Finished:** Move tasks to the "Finished" section by checking them off.
- **Consistent Styling:** Follows the color scheme and design principles of the related HTML & CSS project.
